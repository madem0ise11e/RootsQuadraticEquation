# RootsQuadraticEquation
Program to find the roots of a quadratic equation in C programming. 

The standard form of a quadratic equation is:
ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b and c are real numbers and
a != 0
The term b2-4ac is known as the discriminant of a quadratic equation. It tells the nature of the roots.
If the discriminant is greater than 0, the roots are real and different.
If the discriminant is equal to 0, the roots are real and equal.
If the discriminant is less than 0, the roots are complex and different.
